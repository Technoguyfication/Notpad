# Notpad

Notpad is a chat client that looks identical to Microsoft's Notepad at first glance.
The main user interface is identical down to the pixel, and it takes many users a few minutes of concentrated observation before they realize it's not actuall Notepad.

Now, I know you're asking. Why would anybody even do this? I've got a simple answer for you. I had this idea when I was in Middle School.

This program is designed to be shared around and used on a school network, it'll look like you're taking notes but in reality you just told your friend across the room what your plans are for this weekend. It's stupid and I doubt anyone will use it, but it's more of a personal challenge at this point.
